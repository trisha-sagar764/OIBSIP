# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project is part of my Data Science internship at Oasis Infobyte. It implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Project Overview

The Iris flower classification is a classic machine learning problem that involves predicting the species of iris flowers based on their morphological characteristics. This project demonstrates fundamental data science workflows including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The project uses the famous Iris dataset which contains:
- 150 samples (50 from each of three species)
- 4 features for each sample:
  - Sepal length (cm)
  - Sepal width (cm)
  - Petal length (cm)
  - Petal width (cm)
- Target variable: Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
